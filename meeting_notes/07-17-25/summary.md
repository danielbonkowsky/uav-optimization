Hey @Robert Heath,

In yesterday's meeting, Ibrahim and I went over the system model, 
channel model, and problem formulation which I had written out in Overleaf. 
We fixed some errors in my expressions, and developed a working version of the
equation for mean spectral efficiency, which is the overall metric that we will
try to optimize.

Next week, I'm going to start trying to optimize this equation!
