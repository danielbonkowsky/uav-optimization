Hey @Robert Heath, today Ibrahim and I went over some of the comments he made 
on my paper and we talked about some of the questions I had regarding our 
model. I showed him the code for the model simulation that we're going to run,
and we decided on the assumptions that we're going to use for it.

Here's the current draft of the paper. I'm still working on making the language
more formal, but the system and channel models are done.
