Today, Ibrahim helped explain to me what needs to be done with the current problem setup in order to turn it into an effective research paper:
- Clearly write out the problem/channel setup and model and motivate why this is an interesting problem
- Find an equation for the thing we're trying to optimize, which will be mean spectral efficiency, and write it out in terms of our other variables
- From there, determine how to solve the optimization problem, whether it can be solved analytically, or by iterative optimization, etc.
After that, we can run simulations to show the efficacy of our solution
