Meeting notes:
- Reviewed current literature on UAVs as aerial coverage links
	- Using drone swarms to cover dead zones has been researched, but gaps exist when considering heterogenous drone swarms
- Why would it be beneficial to use drones with differing capabilities?
	- Fixed-wing drone flies out to rural location and deploys drone swarm, acting as their aerial base station
	- Strengths of multiple different drone types can be utilized (e.g., carrying capacity of fixed wing UAVs, mobility of small quadcopters)
- What applications are there?
	- Network coverage in emergency situations
	- Agriculture (i.e., precise fertilization or pesticides in rural areas)
	- Disaster monitoring
	- Crowd surveillance (dead coverage zones arise due to high amount of people?)
	- Oceanic monitoring (UAVs are deployed from ship to scout or do marine bio stuff?)
- Next steps
	- Continue reading research to refine problem and application of heterogenous drone swarm
	- Begin to install different simulators (ROS, gazebo, MATLAB UAV library)
